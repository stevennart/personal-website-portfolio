# What I Learned

* Implemented the structure of my website with the use of HTML5, which includes a user navigation bar, portfolio sections detailing information about myself, technical projects, and a contact form.  
* Used Bootstrap 4 to manage the layout and also add responsiveness to the web page. 
* Tweaked the presentation layer of the website by incorporating fixed background images, active link color changes, and fonts with CSS3. 
* Integrated smooth scrolling with the use of jQuery when navigating to different sections of the page once a navigation link is clicked on.
